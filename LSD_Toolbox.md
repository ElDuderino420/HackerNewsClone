## Division of Sub-systems
#### Subsystems
Our system consists of a number of different subsystems, that depend on each other for the system to function optimally. 
In our implementation we have decided on the following separation:
- Backend/server: Contains logic for interacting with our Mongo database and a REST Api for interacting with the frontend and the teacher tests.
- Mongo database: A NoSQL database, that holds all of our persistent information (such as posts and users).
- Frontend: An AngularJS application that interacts with the backend for data to populate its views.
- Buildserver/Jenkins: A separate entity that manages the deployment of all the other subsystems.
#### General strategy
The common factor for all of the above is that they all reside in individual docker containers. 
This has several distinct advantages, as opposed to deploying everything in one monolithic web application. Most notably it allow us to treat each of the aforementioned subsystems as modules, which means we can make changes to them individually without affecting the remainder of the system. A fairly common case where this is very efficient is when we need to update the frontend (eg. fixing a misspelled spring presented to the user), which is a rather common procedure. 
Now, in a traditional monolithic web application ( this would require us to rebuild the entire application from scratch, with the fix included, but with our architecture we can push the fix, and the only thing affected system would be the frontend - the server and database is unaffected.   
Another potential gain from this division of the system is that we don’t necessarily have to host the various subsystems in the same location. At the moment we host our application over three different servers in four different docker containers (the backend and database resides on the same virtual machine, still in different containers though. We did this for convenience and in an effort to limit the latency for the servers database queries).

### Backend
#### Database
This module consists of nothing but an instance of MongoDB running in a separate docker container. We connect the server to the Mongo container by finding it’s IP with the command: 
<br>**_“docker inspect $CID | grep IPAddress | cut -d '"' -f 4”_**
<br>Where $CID represents the container ID obtained through the command:
<br>**_“docker ps”_**
<br>Besides the above, nothing really exciting is going on in this part of the system.

#### Server
This module consists of a Node.js/Express http server, that contains all our API endpoints. 
<br>![alt text][server_1]<br>
To make for seamless integration between the API and the frontend  (that consumes the responses from the API), we use a combination of two strategies. Firstly we make sure to heavily comment on all the methods in our API. Below is an example of this practice
<br>![alt text][server_2]<br>
Secondly we make use of a continuously updated document, that resides in the git repositories root folder. This document, called “HackerNewsApiDocumentation” contains documentation and examples for every single endpoint in the API. Here follows an example:
<br>![alt text][server_3]<br>
Together the above practices assures we always have up-to-date and easily accessible documentation at hand for developing up against the REST API.  


### Frontend
#### Description of Modules
<br>![alt text][frontend_1]<br>

#### Nginx
This is a load balancing feature which is used to have multiple instances of backend running so that even if one goes down the site continuous. As we are using continuous integration with Jenkins, this also means that when updating the backend, it is down sequentially. So that one of the the backend instances also operates, while the other is updating.

<br>![alt text][frontend_2]<br>

## Logical Data Model
The above is our logical data model. It deviates quite a bit from the usual SQL based models. Since we use Mongo DB we have seen no sense in dividing the model into more than two parts.
<br>![alt text][lgm_1]<br>
We plan on implementing more fields in the post, at a later point (the backend is still a work in progress). Chief amongst these is the comment_parent which serves the purpose of alleviating some pressure from the backend, since finding all the replies to a heavily commented post would demand a lot of search queries to the database.   
<br>In essence a given user just submits posts, the rest is logic in the database facade.   

## Use Cases
<br>![alt text][use_case]
### A brief introduction to the use cases and actors
#### Actors
- The one most noticeble is Bob, who is a site user, which is why we will refer to Bob in most cases.
- Helge, is our other actor who only uses some of the backend.
- The last one is the Status, which is the middleman for checking if the server is down, alive or updating

#### Use Cases
- As a user you can Browse Stories posted on the site.
- As a user you can register, so the system can recognize you.
- As a registered user you can login, so that others can recognize you, and gain access to other features on the site.
- As a logged in user you can post stories and/or comments, so that other users may read them.
- As a logged in user you can upvote stories and comments and gain 1 karma per upvote.
- As a logged in user you can flag any content for spam.
- As a logged in user with more than 500 karma you can downvote stories and comments.
- As a logged in user you can logout of the system.
- As a user you can try out our own Loanbroker system from the System Integration Course.
- As a Helge you can post superfluous users.
- As a Helge you can post stories with those users containing hanesst_id.
- As a Helge you can get the latest hanesst_id post.
- As an application you can check the status of the site.

### A thorough description of the use cases

| **Use Case Name** | **Browse Stories** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Participating actor instances** | **Bob** :Unregistered User |
| **Flow of events** |   1. While Bob is viewing the site he can browse all stories and comments. |

| **Use Case Name** | **Register User** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Participating actor instances** | **Bob** :Unregistered User |
| **Flow of events** | 1. While Bob is viewing the site there is an button on which to register <br>2. Bob clicks the button and is asked to fill in some user information about himself.<br> 3. Bob then clicks register user after all information has been filled in. <br> 4. Bob is now a registered user. |
